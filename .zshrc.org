#+TITLE: .zshrc
#+DESCRIPTION: A Post-installation script for my .zshrc file
#+AUTHOR: Tolemariam Fufa Teso
#+PROPERTY: header-args :tangle ~/.zshrc
#+auto_tangle: t
#+STARTUP: showeverything

* My zshrc config

If you come from bash you might have to change your $PATH.
#+begin_src z shell

export PATH=$HOME/bin:$HOME/.local/bin:/usr/local/bin:$PATH

#+end_src

* Path to your oh-my-zsh installation.
#+begin_src z shell

export ZSH="$HOME/.oh-my-zsh"

#+end_src
* Theme

Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
load a random theme each time oh-my-zsh is loaded, in which case,
to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes

#+begin_src z shell

ZSH_THEME="xiong-chiamiov-plus"

#+end_src

* List of themes, Case and Hyphen

Set list of themes to pick from when loading at random
Setting this variable when ZSH_THEME=random will cause zsh to load
a theme from this variable instead of looking in $ZSH/themes/
 If set to an empty array, this variable will have no effect.
 
 #+begin_src z shell
# ZSH_THEME_RANDOM_CANDIDATES=( "robbyrussell" "agnoster" )
#+end_src

Uncomment the following line to use case-sensitive completion.

#+begin_src z shell
# CASE_SENSITIVE="true"
#+end_src

Uncomment the following line to use hyphen-insensitive completion.
Case-sensitive completion must be off. _ and - will be interchangeable.

#+begin_src z shell

# HYPHEN_INSENSITIVE="true"

#+end_src

* Auto-update behavior
 Uncomment one of the following lines to change the auto-update behavior
 
 #+begin_src z shell

# zstyle ':omz:update' mode disabled  # disable automatic updates
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode auto      # update automatically without asking
# zstyle ':omz:update' mode reminder  # just remind me to update when it's time

#+end_src

Uncomment the following line to change how often to auto-update (in days).
#+begin_src z shell

# zstyle ':omz:update' frequency 13
#+end_src
* Pasting URLs
Uncomment the following line if pasting URLs and other text is messed up.
#+begin_src z shell

# DISABLE_MAGIC_FUNCTIONS="true"

#+end_src
* Disable colors
Uncomment the following line to disable colors in ls.
#+begin_src z shell

# DISABLE_LS_COLORS="true"
#+end_src
* Auto-setting terminals
 Uncomment the following line to disable auto-setting terminal title.
 #+begin_src z shell

# DISABLE_AUTO_TITLE="true"
#+end_src
* Auto-correction
 Uncomment the following line to enable command auto-correction.
 #+begin_src z shell

# ENABLE_CORRECTION="true"
#+end_src

* Red dots
Uncomment the following line to display red dots whilst waiting for completion.
You can also set it to another string to have that shown instead of the default red dots.
e.g. COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="%F{yellow}waiting...%f"
Caution: this setting can cause issues with multiline prompts in zsh < 5.7.1 (see #5765)

#+begin_src z shell

# COMPLETION_WAITING_DOTS="true"
#+end_src
* Untracked files
 Uncomment the following line if you want to disable marking untracked files
under VCS as dirty. This makes repository status check for large repositories
much, much faster.
#+begin_src z shell

# DISABLE_UNTRACKED_FILES_DIRTY="true"

#+end_src
* Execution time command
Uncomment the following line if you want to change the command execution time
stamp shown in the history command output.
You can set one of the optional three formats:
 "mm/dd/yyyy"|"dd.mm.yyyy"|"yyyy-mm-dd"
 or set a custom format using the strftime function format specifications,
 see 'man strftime' for details.
 
 #+begin_src z shell

# HIST_STAMPS="mm/dd/yyyy"

#+end_src
* Using another custom folder than $ZSH
Would you like to use another custom folder than $ZSH/custom?
#+begin_src z shell

# ZSH_CUSTOM=/path/to/new-custom-folder
#+end_src

* Plugins
 Which plugins would you like to load?
Standard plugins can be found in $ZSH/plugins/
Custom plugins may be added to $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/
 Example format: plugins=(rails git textmate ruby lighthouse)
Add wisely, as too many plugins slow down shell startup.
#+begin_src z shell

plugins=(git zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting)

source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh

#+end_src

* User configuration
#+begin_src z shell


# export MANPATH="/usr/local/man:$MANPATH"

#+end_src
* Language environment
 You may need to manually set your language environment
 #+begin_src z shell

# export LANG=en_US.UTF-8

#+end_src

* Preferred editor for local and remote sessions
#+begin_src z shell

# if [[ -n $SSH_CONNECTION ]]; then
#   export EDITOR='vim'
# else
#   export EDITOR='mvim'
# fi

#+end_src

* Compilation flags
#+begin_src z shell

# export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"

#+end_src
* Aliases
Set personal aliases, overriding those provided by oh-my-zsh libs,
plugins, and themes. Aliases can be placed here, though oh-my-zsh
users are encouraged to define aliases within the ZSH_CUSTOM folder.
For a full list of active aliases, run `alias`.

 Example aliases
 #+begin_src z shell

# alias zshconfig="mate ~/.zshrc"

	git push
}
#+end_src
